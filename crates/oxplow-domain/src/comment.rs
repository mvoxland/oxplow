//! Comments: threaded annotations anchored to a text selection on any
//! page (wiki body, code file lines, task detail, …).
//!
//! A [`Comment`] is the thread anchor + metadata; the back-and-forth
//! lives in [`CommentMessage`] rows (including the first message). The
//! pair travels together as a [`CommentThread`] so callers fetch a
//! whole conversation in one shot.
//!
//! Anchoring is deliberately resilient rather than positional: `quote`
//! (the selected text) is the durable anchor and the context handed to
//! the agent; `anchor_json` is an opaque per-surface position *hint*
//! that the renderer re-validates on load and may rewrite. When the
//! quote can no longer be located the comment is marked `orphaned` —
//! it still shows in the inbox, just without an inline highlight.
